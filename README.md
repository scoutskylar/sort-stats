# Sort Stats
This webpage was adapted for better UX by Skylar Smith in 2021 as an AP Statistics student at Fishers High School. It is originally from a different [webpage](http://www.ltcconline.net/greenl/java/Statistics/catStatProb/categorizingStatProblemsJavaScript.html) by Larry Green, a member of the faculty of Lake Tahoe Community College.
It is hosted at [scoutskylar.github.io/sort-stats](https://scoutskylar.github.io/sort-stats/). Prior to Summer 2021, it was also hosted at schedlink.com/sort-stats.
