# Sort Stats
This webpage was adapted for better UX by Skylar Smith, an AP Statistics student at Fishers High School. It is originally from a different [webpage](http://www.ltcconline.net/greenl/java/Statistics/catStatProb/categorizingStatProblemsJavaScript.html) by Larry Green, a member of the faculty of Lake Tahoe Community College.
As of Spring 2021, it is hosted at [schedlink.com/sort-stats](https://schedlink.com/sort-stats/). It is also hosted at [scoutskylar.github.io/sort-stats](https://scoutskylar.github.io/sort-stats/) in case the SchedLink page or SchedLink itself is removed from existence.
